# Stock Market Prediction

This project predicts stock market prices using machine learning techniques. It utilizes historical stock market data and applies a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for prediction.

## Overview

- Collect historical stock market data.
- Preprocess the data by handling missing values and scaling the features.
- Engineer relevant features for prediction.
- Build and train an LSTM model.
- Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
- Use the trained model to make stock market price predictions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies using pip:

2. Prepare the historical stock market data in a CSV format.

3. Run the main Python script to train the LSTM model and make predictions:

4. Adjust the model's hyperparameters and experiment with different features for improved predictions.
